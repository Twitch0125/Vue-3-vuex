# vuex-replacement

Just trying out Vue 3 and the composition API using the vue-next plugin.  
I tried to roughly simulate vuex and modules, but I'm not sure what the best design or DX would be. It relies on Dependency Injection which is new to me, i've never had to use it with Vue :p

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
